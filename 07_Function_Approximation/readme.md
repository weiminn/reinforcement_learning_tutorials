# Function Approximation

## Disadvantages of State Aggregation

1. Limited Precision

2. Complexity increases exponentially with dimensions of discretized states:

$$
\begin{equation}
    O(n^k)
\end{equation}
$$

where $n$ is the number of segments (aggregated discrete states) and $k$ is the number of dimensions.
